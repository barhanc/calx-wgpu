 * A tensor value in a serialized program — declares a GPU buffer with its

 *
 * Every tensor value maps to exactly one `GPUBuffer` at runtime. The buffer
 * source is determined by the optional fields:
 *
 * - **Constant** (`weightsOffset` present): data is loaded from `weights.bin`
 *   into a dedicated buffer during {@link WgpuExecutionContext.recordProgram}.
 *   These are model weights and stay immutable after upload.
 *
 * - **Shared pool** (`memObjId` present): the tensor is allocated inside a
 *   shared memory pool (see {@link ProgramPool}). Multiple tensors in the same
 *   pool share one `GPUBuffer` because their lifetimes don't overlap — the
 *   memory planner guarantees only one is live at a time.
 *
 * - **Dedicated** (neither present): a standalone `GPUBuffer` allocated just
 *   for this value. Used when the memory planner can't find a pool to share.
